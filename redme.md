## Project Vision
The project aims to provide a transparent, automated, and fair system for rewarding participants in coding hackathons. By utilizing blockchain technology, this platform ensures:
- Integrity and immutability of data.
- Transparent reward distribution.
- Trustless interactions between organizers and participants.

## Key Features
1. **Hackathon Management**
   - Organizers can create hackathons with specific titles, reward pools, start times, and end times.
   - Hackathons can be deactivated by the owner when needed.

2. **Participant Points Tracking**
   - Points can be assigned to participants during the hackathon by the organizer.
   - Points are cumulative and recorded per hackathon.

3. **Reward Distribution**
   - Participants can claim rewards proportionally to their points after the hackathon ends.
   - Reward distribution is automated and based on the hackathon's reward pool.

4. **Secure Fund Management**
   - The contract can receive Ether to fund hackathons.
   - Ensures only the owner can allocate rewards or modify hackathon details.

5. **Event Logging**
   - Logs key actions such as hackathon creation, point updates, and reward claims for transparency.
